A client that downloads albums from imgur and compiles it into a pdf file

The request to get an album: https://api.imgur.com/3/album/{id}/images

Notes for the user:
Imgur's API requires a client key.
This means that you have to create your own imgur account and get a key
directly from imgur.
The program will read in a key from key.txt in res/ directory

Album ID is read from a file: ID.txt
