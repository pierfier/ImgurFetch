A client that downloads albums from imgur and compiles it into an epub file

The request to get an album: https://api.imgur.com/3/album/{id}/images

Notes for the user:
Imgur's API requires a client key.
This means that you have to create your own imgur account and get a key
directly from imgur.

The key and id must from come a file specified as a commandline argument

The epub file creation is based on epub file tutorial
